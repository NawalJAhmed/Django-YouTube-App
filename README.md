 SQLite was the database system used as Django uses SQLite by default. For a more scalable database, PostgreSQL is ideal.

The application uses the jumbotron Bootstrap theme.

To start the development server, open the directory containing the source files in a terminal and run the command `python manage.py runserver`. To change the port if the default one is in use, `python manage.py runserver XXXX`.
